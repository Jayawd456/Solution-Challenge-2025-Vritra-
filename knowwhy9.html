    <h1>Why 9 Million Tuberculosis Cases Are Reported Annually</h1>

    <div class="info-box">
        <h2>The Global Tuberculosis Challenge</h2>
        <p>Tuberculosis (TB) remains a significant global health challenge, with approximately 9 million new cases reported each year. This persistent health crisis stems from a complex interplay of medical, social, and economic factors.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="key-factors">
        <h2>Key Factors Contributing to High TB Case Numbers</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Poverty and Living Conditions</strong>
                <p>Overcrowded, poorly ventilated living spaces in low-income areas create ideal conditions for TB transmission. Limited access to healthcare and nutritious food weakens immune systems, making individuals more susceptible to infection.</p>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Limited Healthcare Access</strong>
                <p>Many regions, particularly in developing countries, lack comprehensive TB screening and treatment programs. This results in delayed diagnosis, incomplete treatment, and continued spread of the disease.</p>
            </li>

            <li><strong>HIV/AIDS Correlation</strong>
                <p>People with HIV have compromised immune systems, making them significantly more vulnerable to TB. The co-infection rate is particularly high in regions with limited medical resources.</p>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Drug Resistance</strong>
                <p>Incomplete treatment and improper antibiotic use have led to multi-drug resistant TB strains, making the disease harder to treat and control.</p>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Global Migration and Population Density</strong>
                <p>Increased global mobility and high-density urban areas facilitate the rapid spread of TB, allowing the bacteria to move quickly between populations.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="info-box">
        <h2>Global Impact</h2>
        <p>Despite significant medical advances, TB continues to be a leading cause of death from infectious disease worldwide. The annual 9 million cases represent not just a medical statistic, but a complex global health challenge requiring coordinated international efforts.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="info-box">
        <h2>Prevention and Hope</h2>
        <p>Addressing the TB epidemic requires:
            - Improved healthcare infrastructure
            - Enhanced public health education
            - Comprehensive screening programs
            - Continued medical research
            - Economic development in vulnerable regions</p>
