                    <p class="text-lg">
                        The global food landscape has dramatically changed since 1975:
                        • Processed and ultra-processed foods became widely available and affordable
                        • Sugar-sweetened beverages saw exponential growth

                    <p class="text-lg">
                        Technological and societal changes reduced physical activity:

                    <p class="text-lg">

                        Complex social dynamics played a significant role:

                        • Lower-income populations having limited access to healthy foods
